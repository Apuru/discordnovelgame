# Discord Novel Game
A visual novel for Discord instead without the visuals. Sound is included but not uploaded due to copyright issues. This was my first game made for Discord that worked as a choose-your-own-adventure type game. Users would vote for which option they wanted with majority choosing the option, in case of ties it would be the last person to vote the tied option. There are two scripts only the second one is included as an example. Promises lead to more promises as an attempt for async. 

This bot worked in conjunction with another bot so one could play background music while this one could play sound effects.
